      "Reasoning: Reasoning: The player data suggests a high likelihood of bot-like behavior due to several key indicators. Firstly, the extremely high Avg_PartyTime of 5956.6364 is a strong bot indicator, as it suggests the player is farming in groups for excessively long hours, which is a common bot behavior. Additionally, the GuildAct_count of 0 implies that the player avoids guild activities, which is another characteristic often associated with bots. The A_Acc value of 7103528, while not extremely low, is on the higher side, which could indicate automated account creation. Lastly, the GuildJoin_count of 0 further supports the notion of bot-like behavior, as bots often do not engage in social aspects of the game like guild membership. The combination of these factors, particularly the extremely high Avg_PartyTime and complete lack of guild activity, leads to a high anomaly score, suggesting that this player is very likely a bot.\n",
