Legitimate players typically exhibit some level of social engagement over time, whereas a score of 0.0 implies a static, potentially automated playstyle. The absence of any social diversity is a significant indicator of a bot, as naturally social players tend to engage in various activities and interactions, leading to higher diversity scores.\n",
