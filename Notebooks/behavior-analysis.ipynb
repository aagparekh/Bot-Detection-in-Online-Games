Your role is to generate an anomaly score (0-100, higher score means more likely to be a bot) and provide concise reasoning based on the player data.\n\nHere is how to interpret each player statistic. Provide context for how each statistic informs your score. Focus on how these characteristics point to a bot.\n\n- **Actor**: The player's unique identifier.\n- **A_Acc**: Account ID of the player; may provide clues about account creation patterns.\n- **Login_day_count**: Number of distinct days the player has logged in. Focus on if low compared to other statitics, this will indicate bot behaviour.\n- **Logout_day_count**: Number of days the player logged out. Should closely align with login days; inconsistencies could be a sign.\n- **Playtime**: Total playtime in seconds. An unusually high total compared to login days could signal a bot farming.\n- **playtime_per_day**: Average playtime per day in seconds. High values here are key identifiers of 24/7 bots.\n- **avg_money**: Average amount of in-game currency. Focus on this, as extreme values here could mean exploits or excessive farming.\n- **Login_count**: Total number of logins; high activity would indicate a bot constantly repeating logins.\n- **ip_count**: Number of unique IP addresses used. A very low counts or a high could signal an anomaly\n- **Max_level**: Maximum level achieved by the player. This, with the above information would provide an indicator on its anomaly.\n\nConsider:\n\n1.  Is the \"Login_day_count\" very low, which would indicate little human input.\n2.  Examine Playtime, playtime_per_day, and avg_money to uncover indications of farming or exploiting.\n3. Look at the ip_count. An extremely large number or low number would indicate bot behaviour\n\nBased on those descriptions, you will be given the following information and need to determine these two things\n\n1.  Determine the **anomaly score** (0-100): A higher score indicates a greater likelihood of the player being a bot. This MUST be provided\n\n2.  Provide a **detailed explanation** of your reasoning. This MUST be provided\n\nYour final output **MUST** follow this structure:\n\nAnomaly Score: [your anomaly score 0-100]\nReasoning: [Your reasoning based on patterns from the statistics.

Additionally, the total playtime is 6329147 seconds, which is unusually high compared to the login days, further supporting the bot farming hypothesis. The avg_money is also relatively high, which could be a sign of exploiting or excessive farming. The ip_count is low at 3, which might indicate the use of a limited set of VPNs or proxies, a common bot behavior. However, the Login_day_count and Logout_day_count are relatively consistent, and the Max_level achieved is 55, which could be a normal progression for a dedicated player. The Login_count is not excessively high, which slightly reduces the bot likelihood. Overall, the high playtime per day and potential exploiting or farming behaviors contribute to the anomaly score of 70.\n----------------------------------------\nPlayer ID: 447250\nAnomaly Score: 40\nReasoning: Reasoning: The player's low \"Login_day_count\" of 4 days, combined with a relatively high \"playtime_per_day\" of 3137 seconds (approximately 52 minutes), could indicate some level of automated play. However, this playtime per day is not excessively high, and the \"avg_money\" of 3.8954 is relatively low, suggesting that the player is not excessively farming or exploiting. The \"ip_count\" of 4 is not unusually high or low, and the \"Login_count\" of 5 is reasonable given the \"Login_day_count\". The \"Max_level\" of 11 is achievable within 4 days of play, especially with consistent daily playtime. Overall, while there are some suspicious patterns, they are not conclusive enough to indicate a high likelihood of bot behavior, hence the moderate anomaly score of 40.\n----------------------------------------\nPlayer ID: 416536\nAnomaly Score: 80\nReasoning: Reasoning: The player's data suggests a high likelihood of being a bot due to several indicators. Firstly, the playtime_per_day is extremely high at 78103 seconds (or approximately 21.7 hours), which is unrealistic for a human player and indicates 24/7 bot activity. Additionally, the total playtime is very high at 5311015 seconds, which, combined with the high playtime_per_day, suggests farming or exploiting behavior. The avg_money is also relatively high, which could be a result of excessive farming. The ip_count is low at 3, which could indicate that the bot is using a limited number of IP addresses to avoid detection. The Login_day_count and Logout_day_count are somewhat consistent, but the high Login_count and playtime_per_day are more indicative of bot behavior. The Max_level achieved is 55, which, given the high playtime, is not unusually high and could be achievable by a bot. Overall, these patterns suggest a high likelihood of the player being a bot, hence the anomaly score of 80.\n----------------------------------------\nPlayer ID: 441912\nAnomaly Score: 80\nReasoning: Reasoning: The player's data suggests a high likelihood of being a bot due to several indicators. Firstly, the playtime_per_day is exceptionally high at 71820.5 seconds, which translates to approximately 20 hours per day, indicating a 24/7 bot-like behavior. Additionally, the total playtime of 1005487 seconds (or around 278 hours) over 14 distinct login days also points towards excessive farming or automated play. The average in-game currency (avg_money) is relatively high at 3397.8583, which could be a sign of exploiting or farming. The ip_count of 5 is somewhat low but not extremely low, and the login_count of 39 over 14 days is moderate. The Max_level achieved is 36, which, given the other statistics, could indicate rapid progression possibly through automated means. The alignment of login and logout days suggests a controlled environment, further supporting the bot hypothesis. Overall, the combination of high playtime per day, significant total playtime, and other factors contribute to the high anomaly score.\n----------------------------------------\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":19},{"cell_type":"code","source":"player_ids_to_check = ['427135', '431622', '213412', '419781', '345701']\nbot_report = generate_bot_report(player_ids_to_check)\n\nfor record in bot_report:\n    print(f\"Player ID: {record['player_id']}\")\n    print(f\"Anomaly Score: {record['anomaly_score']}\")\n    print(f\"Reasoning: {record['reasoning']}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-02-12T16:07:04.879730Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-02-12T16:07:04.880056Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-02-12T16:07:28.161687Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-02-12T16:07:04.880029Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-02-12T16:07:28.160994Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Player ID: 427135\nAnomaly Score: 80\nReasoning: Reasoning: The player's data suggests a high likelihood of being a bot due to several indicators.

Additionally, the total playtime is very high at 6808618 seconds, which, combined with the high playtime_per_day, suggests farming or exploiting. The avg_money is relatively moderate but still could be a sign of farming given the high playtime. The ip_count is very low at 1, which could indicate that the player is always logging in from the same location, a common trait of bots. The Login_day_count and Logout_day_count are relatively consistent, but the high playtime and low ip_count are strong indicators of bot behavior. The Max_level achieved is 55, which, given the high playtime, is not unusually high but still suggests efficient progression, possibly automated. Overall, these factors contribute to a high anomaly score.\n----------------------------------------\nPlayer ID: 213412\nAnomaly Score: 60\nReasoning: Reasoning: The player's data suggests some anomalous behavior, but it's not conclusive. The \"Login_day_count\" of 84 days indicates regular human-like activity. However, the \"playtime_per_day\" of 81993 seconds (approximately 22.75 hours) is unusually high, suggesting the player might be playing for extended periods, which is a common trait of bots. The \"avg_money\" of 52737 is not extremely high, but it's notable. The \"ip_count\" of 2 is relatively low, which could indicate the player is using a VPN or proxy, a common practice among bots. The \"Max_level\" of 55 achieved in 84 days is impressive but not impossible for a dedicated human player. The discrepancy between \"Login_day_count\" and \"Logout_day_count\" is minor. Considering these factors, the player's behavior is suspicious but not definitively bot-like, warranting a moderate anomaly score of 60.\n----------------------------------------\nPlayer ID: 419781\nAnomaly Score: 80\nReasoning: Reasoning: The player's data exhibits several characteristics that suggest bot-like behavior. Firstly, the playtime_per_day is exceptionally high at 17512.2778 seconds, which translates to approximately 4.85 hours per day. This consistent, high daily playtime is a key indicator of a 24/7 bot. Additionally, the total Playtime of 315221 seconds (or about 87.5 hours) over 18 distinct days also points towards automated farming or grinding. The avg_money is also relatively high, which could indicate exploiting or excessive farming. The ip_count of 12 is somewhat suspicious, as it suggests the player may be using multiple IP addresses, potentially to evade detection. However, the Login_day_count and Logout_day_count align closely, and the Login_count is not excessively high, which slightly mitigates the anomaly score. Overall, the high playtime per day, potential exploiting, and multiple IP addresses used contribute to a high anomaly score, indicating a strong likelihood of the player being a bot.\n----------------------------------------\nPlayer ID: 345701\nAnomaly Score: 60\nReasoning: Reasoning: The player's data suggests some bot-like behavior, but it's not conclusive. The \"Login_day_count\" is relatively normal, indicating some human input. However, the \"playtime_per_day\" is high, averaging over 3 hours per day, which could indicate a bot farming or playing excessively. The \"avg_money\" is also somewhat high, which might suggest exploiting or farming, but it's not extreme. The \"ip_count\" is low, with only 3 unique IP addresses, which could indicate a bot using a limited number of proxies or VPNs. The \"Max_level\" achieved is 36, which is significant, but not unusually high considering the playtime. The \"Login_count\" is moderate, which doesn't strongly suggest bot behavior.
