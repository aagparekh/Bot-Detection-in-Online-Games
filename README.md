# Bot-Detection-in-Online-Games
🎮 Gaming Bot Detection System

An AI-powered system to identify automated players (bots) in online multiplayer games
🤖 What This Does

This system analyzes player behavior to detect bots - automated programs that play games 24/7, perform repetitive actions, and give unfair advantages. It acts like a detective, examining player patterns and using AI to determine who's human and who's a bot.

Why It Matters:

    Ensures fair play for legitimate players
    Protects game economies from artificial manipulation
    Maintains authentic social gaming experiences

🔍 How It Works
Detection Methods

Our system examines multiple behavioral patterns:

    ⏰ Time Patterns: Players online 24/7 vs. normal human schedules
    🎯 Activity Patterns: Repetitive actions vs. natural human variation
    💰 Resource Collection: Unusually high gains (500+ XP/day consistently)
    👥 Social Behavior: Zero interactions vs. normal player socializing
    🌐 Login Patterns: Multiple IP addresses indicating bot farms

AI Scoring System

Each player gets a suspicion score (0-100):

    0-30: Likely human
    31-70: Suspicious, needs review
    71-100: Very likely bot

🏗️ System Architecture

Core Components

    Knowledge Graph Database (Neo4j)
        Stores player data and relationships
        Enables complex pattern analysis

    Detection Agents
        Anomaly Scoring: Overall behavior analysis
        Social Diversity: Interaction pattern analysis
        Action Patterns: Repetitive behavior detection
        Group Activity: Guild/party participation analysis

    AI-Powered Analysis
        Uses large language models for pattern recognition
        Provides human-readable explanations
        Finds similar suspicious players

📊 Sample Detection Report

Player ID: 8085
Anomaly Score: 92/100 (Very Likely Bot)

Key Findings:
- Playtime: 18+ hours daily for 88 consecutive days
- Login sessions: 1,065 times (12+ per day)
- Social interactions: Nearly zero
- Resource gains: Exceptionally high and consistent

Recommendation: Immediate investigation

🚀 Quick Start
For Game Managers

    Provide suspicious player IDs to the system
    Review generated reports (written in plain English)
    Make moderation decisions based on scores and explanations

🤝 Acknowldgements

This project uses the Game Bot Detection Dataset from HCRL, based on user behavior logs from the MMORPG Aion. Please cite Kang et al., SpringerPlus, 2016 when using this dataset.

Important: This tool assists human decision-making. Always combine automated detection with human judgment for fair and accurate results.
